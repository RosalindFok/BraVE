Inferotemporal Cortex (ITC) 
Demonstrating the existence of a pair of orthogonal gradients that differ in spatial scale and revealing significant differences in the functional organization of high-level visual areas between monkey and human brains.
We set out to tackle these challenges by constructing a high-dimensional object space and compute the selectivity of each brain location within this object space. Inspired by recent advances at the intersection of artificial intelligence and neuroscience18,35,36,37, a 25D object space was constructed using responses of units in a deep neural network to a large database of natural images, and functional MRI experiments were conducted in both monkeys and humans to map out the feature preference of the visual temporal lobe. The resulting preference maps helped us determine the functions of previously uncharted territories and reveal differences in the functional organization of high-level visual areas between monkey and human brains.

we propose a novel deep generative multiview model(Variational Auto-Encoders, VAE) for the accurate visual image reconstruction from the human brain activities measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). On the one hand, we adopt a deep neural network architecture for visual image generation, which mimics the stages of human visual processing. On the other hand, we design a sparse Bayesian linear model for fMRI activity generation, which can effectively capture voxel correlations, suppress data noise, and avoid overfitting. Furthermore, we devise an efficient mean-field variational inference method to train the proposed model. The proposed method can accurately reconstruct visual images via Bayesian inference. In particular, we exploit a posterior regularization technique in the Bayesian inference to regularize the model posterior. The quantitative and qualitative evaluations conducted on multiple fMRI data sets demonstrate the proposed method can reconstruct visual images more accurately than the state of the art.

Here, we developed a novel fMRI-conditional video generative adversarial network (f-CVGAN) to reconstruct rapid video stimuli from evoked fMRI responses. In this model, we employed a generator to produce spatiotemporal reconstructions and employed two separate discriminators (spatial and temporal discriminators) for the assessment. We trained and tested the f-CVGAN on two publicly available video-fMRI datasets, and the model produced pixel-level reconstructions of 8 perceived video frames from each fMRI volume.

 In this work, we present MinD-Vis: Sparse Masked Brain Modeling with Double-Conditioned Latent Diffusion Model for Human Vision Decoding. Firstly, we learn an effective self-supervised representation of fMRI data using mask modeling in a large latent space inspired by the sparse coding of information in the primary visual cortex. Then by augmenting a latent diffusion model with double-conditioning, we show that MinD-Vis can reconstruct highly plausible images with semantically matching details from brain recordings using very few paired annotations.
